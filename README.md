# ST449_final_Q
This is the code for The paper "Spatio-Temporal Heterogeneous Contrasting for MTS Classification" for ST449, based on a given study "Graph-Aware Contrasting for Multivariate Time-Series Classification", one state of art self- supervised algorithm for multivariate time series classification, we designed novel loss functions, and propose the algorithm called "STH-GCL".
